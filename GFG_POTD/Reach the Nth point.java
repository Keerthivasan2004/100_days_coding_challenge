/*There are N points on the road, you can step ahead by 1 or 2 . If you start from a point 0, and can only move from point i to point i+1 after taking a step of length one, find the number of ways you can reach at point N. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4
Output: 
5
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 4th
point. They are {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2},
{1, 2, 1} {2, 1, 1}, {2, 2}.

Example 2:

Input: N = 5
Output: 8
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 5th
point. They are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
{1, 1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 1},
{2, 1, 1, 1}{1, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 2}, {2, 2, 1}
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function nthPoint() which takes N as input parameter and returns the total number of ways modulo 109 + 7 to reach at Nth point.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5*/

Solution:

class Solution
{
    public int nthPoint(int n)
    {
        int zeroth_step = 1, first_step = 1, steps = 0;
        int mod = (int) (1e9 + 7);
        for(int ith_step = 2; ith_step <= n; ith_step++){
            steps = (int) ((first_step%mod + zeroth_step%mod)%mod);
            zeroth_step = first_step;
            first_step = steps;
        }
        return first_step;
    }
}
